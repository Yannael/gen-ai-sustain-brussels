- Day 3, half day (3 hours) - [Yann-Aël Le Borgne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannaelb/): Hands-on workshop on using open-source generative AI models with Hugging Face, and deploying Gradio web applications. Examples are mostly taken from [Hugging Face online course on large language models](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1?fw=pt). The session covered:

	- Text generation with open-source models (such as GPT2) using the Hugging Face transformers library
	- Building a web app with Gradio
	- Making a Gradio web app predict text with the transformers library, or OpenAI API
	- Deploying the web app on Hugging Face spaces for free
