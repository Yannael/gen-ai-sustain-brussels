If provided, it appears _below_ the input and output components.\n","- `theme`: don't like the default colors? Set the theme to use one of `default`, `huggingface`, `grass`, `peach`. You can also add the `dark-` prefix, e.g. `dark-peach` for dark theme (or just `dark` for the default dark theme).\n","- `examples`: to make your demo *way easier to use*, you can provide some example inputs for the function. These appear below the UI components and can be used to populate the interface. These should be provided as a nested list, in which the outer list consists of samples and each inner list consists of an input corresponding to each input component.\n","- `live`: if you want to make your demo \"live\", meaning that your model reruns every time the input changes, you can set `live=True`.
